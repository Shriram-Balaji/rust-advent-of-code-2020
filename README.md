> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository has my solutions for Advent of Code 2020, in Rust :crab:. I also blog about my learnings while solving these puzzles [here](https://hashnode.com/series/advent-of-code-2020-with-rust-cki7q68hw03wcnts153zx4aq0).


## Running it locally

If you'd like to run the code, do:

```sh
# where `<number>` represents the days 01 - 30.
cargo run --bin day-<number> inputs/day-<number>.txt
```
